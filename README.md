# LLM-Dataset-Generator
Repo contains code for LLM dataset generator which can help create question answer pairs using your very own PDF file.

Creating datasets for fine-tuning an LLM can be a daunting task and not so enjoyable :(

Hence, I created and deployed an app called LLM Dataset Generator where you can upload your PDF file and create traing and validation datasets and download it in 2 most-used formats, csv and jsonl.

The app gives you the flexibility to set your training and validation set split and set your own context.
